# Wordle solver in C#
I wrote this application a long ago. And I have lost my project and the source code, sadly cannot improve it.

## important update
Holy shit apparently this works on linux too.
by typing `chmod +x wordle.exe` and then executing it with `./wordle.exe`


Tested on linux mint
```
chmod +x wordle.exe
./wordle.exe
```
